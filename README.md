## Hurricane Data Analysis

This Codecademy project involves analyzing hurricane data to derive meaningful insights. The data includes information on hurricanes' names, occurrence months and years, maximum sustained winds, affected areas, recorded damages, and fatalities. The analysis includes several key functions:

1. **Updating Recorded Damages:**
   - A function converts damage values from string format (e.g., `100M`, `1.54B`) into numerical values. This standardization allows for consistent data handling and analysis.

2. **Creating a Hurricane Dictionary:**
   - A dictionary is created to store detailed information about each hurricane. The dictionary includes the hurricane's name, month and year of occurrence, maximum sustained winds, affected areas, and death toll.

3. **Organizing Hurricanes by Year:**
   - A function organizes hurricanes into groups based on the year they occurred. This allows for chronological analysis of hurricane data.

4. **Counting Damaged Areas:**
   - This function counts the number of hurricanes that affected each area, providing insights into the frequency of impact across different regions.

5. **Finding the Most Affected Area:**
   - This function identifies the area that has been hit by the most hurricanes and counts the number of times it was affected.

6. **Calculating the Deadliest Hurricane:**
   - A function determines which hurricane caused the highest number of deaths and reports the death toll.

7. **Rating Hurricanes by Mortality:**
   - Hurricanes are rated based on their mortality, using predefined categories. This function categorizes hurricanes into different mortality ratings and groups them accordingly.

8. **Adding Damage Information:**
   - The function integrates damage data into the hurricane dictionary, adding a `Damages` key with the recorded damage values.

9. **Finding the Most Damaging Hurricane:**
   - This function identifies the hurricane with the highest damage cost and reports the total damage.

10. **Rating Hurricanes by Damage:**
    - Hurricanes are rated based on the damage they caused. The function categorizes hurricanes into damage ratings and organizes them into a dictionary accordingly.

These functions provide a comprehensive view of hurricane impacts, enabling further analysis and insights into historical hurricane data.
